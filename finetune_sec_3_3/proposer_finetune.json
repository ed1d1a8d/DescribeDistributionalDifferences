You're the new kid, and you have to make friends fast. It's good to be social on the first day, but after that it's best not to be too chatty-chattery in class because teachers don't like it when students talk with each other during lectures. I'm sure you've seen those kids before who are constantly talking or texting on their phones during class - it's really rude, and teachers will let them know about it with stern looks or detention slips. It seems like high school is just one long obstacle course of tests and papers, but that doesn't mean we can skip out on extracurriculars! There are tons of clubs around here for all different interests: chess club, student council...even a dance team!

Let's say he is using base-three exponentiation: \\(10^{-1}\\) (or one tenth). That would mean that one unit of measurement was dropped off and it will now be represented as having an exponent of -1; this would make it equivalent to ten thousandths (10e-2). Therefore, the two rightmost digits in our answer are 2 and can now be swapped with each other. Moving on! The appropriate solution is now getting shifted by 2 hours.

He said that we should all take a moment to say a prayer for him and his family before we went out into the streets.The next morning, while we were waiting outside of City Hall for Mayor Castor's speech, we heard shots ring out down the street. We turned around and saw smoke coming from one of those houses near where they found his body last night. Someone yelled \"shots fired,\" so everyone started running towards it with their guns drawn and ready to shoot whoever was inside there shooting at people again like they did last night hitting Officer Garcia twice in the head killing him instantly without remorse or regret because he had done this same thing before but never got caught until now because he thought no one knew who he was until someone recognized him from surveillance video taken yesterday after h ...\nGroup A: One of the most important jobs in our society is police work. In order to withstand the daily stresses that come with this job, it's essential that these people stay healthy. Proper diet, exercise, and coping techniques are all necessary to keep oneself mentally and physically strong to handle these challenging situations.After witnessing many traumatic events throughout their careers involving death or injury on a regular basis, police officers need help adjusting back into everyday life after their service ends which only adds more pressure making a change in lifestyle even more difficult. Twenty-five years ago being a cop was considered \"cool.\" But nowadays high school students have less interest because they think being a cop would be boring or not as cool as it used to be because reality has set in about how tough this profession really is.So while policing may still seem like an honorable calling for some people who want an adventurous job where you can save lives by stopping cri ...\nGroup A: As a society, we need to be mindful of these brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day.

People are angry about how law enforcement officers treat them with hostility and disrespect, especially in cases where people of color are at risk.

A lack of trust has built up over time because communities don't always get justice when crimes happen to them or their loved ones, and that hurts everyone's sense of safety and security.\nGroup A: Our communities are susceptible to crime when, like in any other community out there, the people feel they need protection. They look to police officers for help. The time has come where we can pursue justice, not revenge; peace not prejudice; pride not mistrust; and unity neither ignorance nor discrimination.

{"prompt": "Group A: There are many words that could be used to describe the experience of viewing a 3D movie - thrilling, overwhelming, nauseating. I will use one word to sum up my experience: uncomfortable. Putting on those glasses was not pleasant because it felt like someone grabbed both my eyes and pulled them outwards so far I thought they would pop out of my head. The extra dimension also resulted in an extreme case of vertigo as I fought for balance while trying not to vomit all over the floor.\nGroup A: Several psychological experiments, such as the stereoscopic movies and the Ames Room experiment, show that 3D motion is processed as a different entity than 2D motion. The most notable difference is that stimuli presented in 3D are perceptually categorized as self-motion. This is because of how one\u2019s eyes and brain interact: with normal vision (or standard HDTV) this disparity is removed and outside observers can see an object moving (like a ball) from A to B simultaneously but with both eyes; however when watching a movie or television program in 3 pts.(3d), it seems like we perceive movement not just on our TV screens but also inside our own heads, which many people feel intense feelings such as nausea.\nGroup A: Theaters and home theaters alike offer a variety of 3D movies, but the best way to watch them is live and in person.

It's thrilling to watch fish swimming or knights battling when your eyes are given two dimensional instructions when they only need one!\nGroup A: I was surprised to find out that a 3D movie is a completely different experience from a 2D one.

It had a lot of exposition, which is important for understanding the characters and their motivations.

Things are so bleak here, and no matter how hard I try to keep myself motivated it's nothing more than a reminder of what is missing from my goals.

This type of system would be called an authoritarianism. An autocracy controls everything but there's still some semblance of democracy; for example, voting (which North Korea prohibits its citizens from doing).

She then picked out some fruits and vegetables, and then went to pay for her items.

{"prompt": "Group A: Nobody likes to go to school. It's not because we don't like learning\u2014for some of us, it's because we can't afford an education. For others, it's because they do better when they're in the comfort of their own home. But nobody likes going to school and when you finally graduate from high school or when your siblings or parents take you out of your educational institution, everybody is happy when summer comes around and no one has to go back in September.\nGroup A: I'm just tired of being in class, sitting there doing nothing. I don't want to do it anymore. I know that we're learning and all, but it's just so boring and pointless. The people around me are annoying and the work is uninteresting. It's not worth my time at all and I'd much rather be doing anything else than sitting in a class for 45 minutes every day.\nGroup A: I can't stand it when I get to college and there are all these new people that I don't know.\nGroup A: I never wanted to go to my classes and I always thought that they were pointless. My teachers would always try to spout off these catchphrases like \"Do your best\" or \"Work hard and you'll succeed.\" But all those phrases did was make me more frustrated because they didn't help me in the slightest. Some of my classmates would bully me, too. They made fun of what I said and how I looked, which just made things worse for myself.

It was all so boring and I didn't feel like it helped me get any better at anything other than remembering facts about things that don't make sense to me. Now, I'm finally free of the place I dreaded every day and the only thing that would have made it better is if high school had been worse because then maybe college would have felt less bad when it came time for me to go there too.\nGroup A: I used to think that I liked my job but now, I actually despise it. You know, we're too busy worrying about placing papers and folders in the right place as opposed to teaching our students anything. And that's not even talking about how some of these parents are extremely inconsiderate! All they do is pay their tuition and then don't want us to ask them questions afterwards because they're tired from work. What kind of crap is that?!\nGroup A: There's two types of people in the world. Those who love school, and those who can't wait to get out of there. The truth is, I'm one of the latter kind- I never liked going to school. It was always so boring and no one ever did anything fun there. That's why I'm glad that it's over for me now- all that time wasted on something that wasn't even enjoyable for me!\nGroup A: I really don't like going to school. I think it's too hard, and none of the teachers are nice there. Plus, I had this really bad experience with a bully in my math class last year that made me not want to go back at all.\nGroup A: I always dreaded the thought of going to class.

After that, place it in either a drying rack or on your countertop to dry off naturally then repeat the process every time you finish one dish until all of your dishes are clean!\nGroup A: I like to use a sponge and soap, but I think the best way to do it is with a scrubber and hot water.\nGroup A: Utensils should be rinsed thoroughly before being placed in the sink.

Next, fill up a sink with hot soapy water and add some dish soap while stirring it all up with your hands or sponge. Now grab some paper towels and get to work! You'll want to start at the top of the pile of dirty plates and cups (or whatever other type of utensils you're using) and work your way down, scrubbing thoroughly as you go along. Rinse off every piece that has been cleaned before moving on to any new dirties that might have popped up since last time - make sure they get special attention because they're not going back in their spots until they've been through the full cycle! When everything looks good enough for human consumption again, rinse off any remaining soap residue by filling up another sink with clean water.\nGroup A: Here are 3 simple steps:1. When you're done using your dishes and bowls, set them in the dirty dish basin. 2.

{"prompt": "Group A: In order to reduce poverty, it's important to assist in the provision of food and shelter. In addition, residents with a higher socioeconomic status need to share with those who are low-income or impoverished. This is something that needs to be done on a global scale due to the fact there is not enough space for everyone in high income countries.\nGroup A: The plan for alleviating the impacts of global inequality is to focus on the quality of life, not just earnings. There are two key aspects to this: earning more and having a high quality of life. The first aspect involves an increase in wages and investments in education, healthcare, childcare services etc. The second aspect entails ensuring minimum living standards such as sanitation facilities and access to clean water supply facilities.\nGroup A: One of the most effective ways to reduce poverty is by providing people with access to clean water.

Raising taxes will help stop businesses from closing due to the lack of income that could come from not paying these high taxes on companies like Walmart or McDonalds who do not make enough profits off their sales but get taxed at such high rates even though it would take small increases in sales just for them give break-even revenue level if they were able with additional funds coming rom higher tax brackets (Bower).

When I said thank you, he made an eyebrow-raising gesture, which is not only disrespectful but also meant to be insulting. For a while, I just ignored him and tried to enjoy my meal in peace.

Regardless of your situation, here is some advice for anyone looking to ace their way through the interview. Preparation for any interview is key- which includes research on the company and any person(s) interviewing you at least 24 hours in advance; review your resume/CV; speak with a trade school advisor about research options in assessing your skills strengths and interests; include keywords like \"team player,\" \"self-starter,\" \"motivated\" in responses which will illustrate how well suited they would be joining that team (ideally questions should be hypothetical so there's no chance of being caught off guard).\nGroup A: Here are some helpful tips for finding an internship:1. Make sure you're qualified before applying for an unpaid position. 2. Be proactive by sending a cover letter and resume to companies of interest or posting your resume on job boards like Indeed, Monster, or Glassdoor. 3. Remember that the competition is high during the summer months; it's more likely for students to get internships in January and February than July-August because there are fewer people looking then due to school being out of session.4.

They wanted to build suspense, so they let the audience wonder what would happen instead of outright stating it. This meant that some scenes dragged on too long or felt out-of-place, which I'm sure is because of editing purposes after production finished. The main character's backstory lacked depth and could have revealed more about their reasoning behind committing crimes.

Heavy metal traces its roots back to the late 70s and early 80s with groups like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin; but it wasn't until heavy metal groups like Metallica started appearing in the 1980s that heavy metal became known internationally. Although many people associate this type of rock with anger, there are also soft edges to these songs which can be particularly beautiful and soothing for those who listen carefully enough.Heavy Metal song lyrics vary by artist; but most contain themes such as death, warcry defiance towards authority figures (most notoriously found in artists like Rob Zombie), vengeance against wrong-doers (often times connected to violence)Metal bands typically rely on electric guitar feedback(sometimes called \"wah\" used primarily during solos).

It is characterized by its distorted and guttural sound and often dark lyrics, with tempo and mood swung to provoke aggression. Heavy metal became recognized as a genre in the 1980s when many bands from different countries merged it with their local styles or pop during this time.

The roads themselves may change as driverless technology starts taking over vehicle controls like steering wheels and brakes; some manufacturers anticipate that highways may need less lanes because computers can smoothly merge traffic together at higher speeds than humans can do with the same dexterity.\nGroup A: The future is uncertain.

It's likely technology will have advanced so much that people are working fewer hours, spending time on self-improvement, and spending more time with family members.

And in hospitals, they'll have highly sensitive sensors for detecting problems in our bodies long before anyone else can detect them.\nGroup A: It's hard to predict the direction our world is heading in, but I think that it's important to be hopeful about the life we're living today.

But either way, my hope is that someday I'll live in a generation with wonder and peace and joy.\nGroup A: It is the year 2037. The world is different now. Our population has tripled, and that's not even counting animals or things like bacteria. We've run out of food, there are no jobs, and all our natural resources are gone. There are only a few million humans left on earth-- enough for some sort of culture to exist but not enough to sustain life as we know it anymore. It's up to us human beings to find new ways forward-- not just for humanity but also for all life on this planet who have been so heavily impacted by our wasteful lifestyles over the past century or so\nGroup A: If I was to tell you there is no such thing as the \"next generation,\" I would not be telling you anything new. Think about it, today's world is teeming with next-generation technology--technology that will change how we do everything from banking to doctoring for years to come.

It tells the story of a woman who has been kept in an old shed for seven years and her son, Jack. The plan is that she will stay there until he's two and then they'll escape together to someplace better. But when Jack turns five, something goes wrong with his plan and she has to find a way out herself because he can't leave without her even though its dangerous for him to be around other people outside of Room too long at once. After reading it, I was so shocked by how well it went into detail about what life would really be like if you were kidnapped or held hostage somewhere like that- especially if you had children because their safety always comes first no matter what happens.\nGroup A: The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie by Alan BradleyA young girl, Flavia de Luce, is raised in a country manor with her two older sisters.

The trips were always so much fun that I never wanted them to end. My dad was an incredible person who knew how to light up any room he walked into just by talking about his work or his love for science fiction novels or football stats.

In the workplace, it often favors certain candidates who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. It can also take away from others who are qualified for the job but don't have the same social group status as a non-privileged background.\nGroup A: Affirmative action is not the answer because it only makes the issue worse.\nGroup A: Ever since affirmative action was first introduced during the 1960s, there have been plenty of arguments both for and against it.

{"prompt": "Group A: One of the most influential movements of the last decade is affirmative action, where consideration for an applicant's race or ethnicity has become part of how admissions decisions are made. Affirmative action seeks to create equal opportunities in employment, but it has also been applied to minority enrollment in colleges and universities nationwide. It's important that people are not denied jobs because they're members of a minority group when there are other qualified candidates who aren't from that group.\nGroup A: Affirmative action is essential in order to make up for the injustices of the past. I believe it's important to provide more opportunities for people who are disadvantaged by their gender, race, or economic standing.\nGroup A: Affirmative action is an act of preferential treatment for members of groups that have been oppressed or exploited.

{"prompt": "Group A: As a woman of color, I agree that affirmative action does not exist for the purposes of promoting diversity. Affirmative action exists to promote equality because it is needed to remedy past discrimination, and ensure a level playing field which will promote an equitable society.\nGroup A: I believe that affirmative action policies are necessary in order to level the playing field and provide opportunities for people who wouldn't otherwise be granted them. I think it's unfair to judge people on their situation, gender or race when considering an opportunity, and so companies should take affirmative action into account because there may already be systemic racism or sexism in the company. Affirmative action provides equal opportunities for all people by way of protection from such things.\nGroup A: It's clear that affirmative action is necessary for diversity in higher education. For decades, cases have shown that people of color are denied equal opportunities because of the school they're trying to go to or their social background. Students deserve better than just being shut out because people are too afraid or unwilling to allow them an opportunity for success.\nGroup A: I think affirmative action is a good thing. It helps to provide equality in different fields of employment, and it allows people from minority groups to have more opportunities than they would otherwise get. I know that there's been a lot of criticism for this idea, but I don't think it's fair to take away opportunities from other people just because they belong to a disadvantaged group.\nGroup A: Affirmative action is still necessary in America, because people of color are still discriminated in the workplace.

That's right, this most often happens when an eel has its neck out of the body cavity - like a lightning bolt coming from a cloud - but it doesn't happen all the time.

The tears just wouldn't stop coming down my face as the thoughts of suicide raced through my head and all the pent up emotions came rushing out of me.

The sun was going down and the air was getting chilly as the lionesses took care of their young.

Health care saves lives and makes them better- so all of us deserve to live with ease and comfort, unbothered by large medical bills we can't afford or we fear we won't be covered for.\nGroup A: It's proven that if you have access to health care, your likelihood to stay well increases. When people are sick, they can't go to work or do other things that are important for their family. They need the health care to get better and be able-bodied again.\nGroup A: Poor Americans who need health care and do not have the money to pay for it typically rely on Medicaid. Medicaid is a government-funded program that provides financial assistance to those who cannot afford medical visits, surgeries, or prescriptions. However, this is not enough. The program has gaps in coverage that are often difficult or impossible for low income families to fill with their own funds alone.\nGroup A: The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is a law that provides tax credits and subsidies to those who need health insurance. It was passed in 2010 and has saved many lives since then by providing quality medical care to those who couldn\u2019t afford it before. However, the people of America voted for President Trump and his Republican party this November (2016). The new plan includes changes like:-Allowing insurance companies to charge different rates for premiums based on gender -Eliminating the individual mandate that requires everyone to buy health insurance or face a penalty -Eliminating Medicaid expansion which offered coverage for low income Americans. This means that 16 million people will lose their healthcare over the next decade because of these changes alone!

It costs $10 billion more each year under ACA so if they change it now there will be an extra $110 billion added onto ...\n\nGroup B: makes a person more anxious\nGroup B: supports a protest\nGroup B: talks about climate change\nGroup B: asks to contact someone on behalf of another person\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " supports universal health care."}
{"prompt": "Group A: It is imperative that we have a universal health care system in place for all Americans. The Affordable Care Act has done a lot to get us closer to this, but there is still so much work left to be done.\nGroup A: The Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare\" as it is known by many, was a landmark legislation passed in the United States. It positions itself as a measure which ensures that those who don't have medical coverage will receive some form of government-sponsored healthcare insurance. This has been met with mixed reviews from those on both sides of the political spectrum, but it's undeniable that there are millions of Americans who would not be able to afford health care without this legislation.\nGroup A: Universal health care would give everyone across the board access to health care. They are most notably for people who cannot afford it, but they also benefit those who do purchase insurance with lower prices. This is important because with poorer quality of life, people are less productive which decreases the GDP by over 18 billion dollars per year in lost productivity alone. Universal health care is advocated for by politicians on both sides of the aisle and organizations around the world including National Nurses United and Doctors Without Borders\nGroup A: Government health care, which is also known as single-payer health care or guaranteed issue, is a system under which everyone receives coverage from one organization.In the United States, government agencies have been experimenting with this type of system since 1969. In 1971, Alaska created a program where all children and pregnant woman were covered by Medicaid and other programs.\nGroup A: Health care should be a basic human right. However, in America, health care only becomes accessible to people who end up with jobs that offer it. So part of the way we need to solve the problem is by pushing legislation to make sure all Americans are insured; not just those fortunate enough to live near an employer with benefits or who can afford healthcare on their own.

The head of the sunflower contains seeds that can be eaten, cooked in salads, or pressed for cooking oil. The petals can also be used to make tea or other dishes.

Some plants can't withstand the temperature of a room or need to be watered constantly.

Others drive. And some even bike! But what happens when you get to your destination? Whether you are boarding a plane, boarding a boat, or getting off the subway at your stop, there are always problems that can come up with arriving on time. One of these issues is traffic congestion which makes it difficult for people to get through intersections quickly and avoid being late for appointments or meetings where they have scheduled departures.

The wealthy have always been able to make their own decisions, but they want us to think that we would decide differently if given a chance? Like what planet do these people live on?\nGroup A: The people in power are not the ones who need help, it's the people at the bottom. The poor and working class know that their living conditions will never improve because of these policies that we have in place. The wealthy get better treatment while they continue to exploit us and we're expected to remain quiet about it so they can stay on top of our society where they've been at for too long? No thank you!

No one cares about the little guys anymore if they're not powerful or powerful enough that their influence could sway things in our favor, huh? Like I said - I don't know why because time after time again, no matter how bad we have it for how long- maybe just once- there's always someone else who has it worse than us before everything shifts back so that we could start contemplating another life under the weight of doom again until weeks later passed us by and where will be now?!\nGroup A: As I scroll through my Facebook feed, all I see are the elite soaking up the sun on their private islands while people in poverty suffer.

Early in the ninth century Charlemagne's son Louis I was crowned emperor and his empire included most of what is now modern day Aquitaine.

It has been getting warmer and cooler throughout history, and there are a number of things that can cause these changes in weather patterns. Another reason why climate change cannot be a reality is because people have been warning about this for years now, yet we still experience cold winters which proves that it isn't really happening.\nGroup A: Temperatures have been fluctuating for centuries. In the 1800s, the earth was warm. This is one reason why people were able to wear less clothes or even get a tan while being outside during warmer months. Throughout this century, there has been a shift in weather patterns and temperatures have declined due to this shift in weather patterns that include more cloudy days and milder winters.\nGroup A: People who are for this theory are people who want to turn the world into a socialist utopia.

The global average surface temperature only increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius between 1880 and 1995, but there has been no significant change since 1998 according to NASA satellite readings.\nGroup A: Climate change is a hoax. It's been proven that it was created by those who want to make money off of other people. The climate has always changed and there are many different factors for this to happen, not just human activities.\nGroup A: Climate change is a hoax. It has not been proven that climate change is evident, even though the media promotes the idea that it's occurring.

The pain should have been worse when my body was torn apart from all the ways I died. But it wasn't - not even close to what I anticipated because my soul felt nothing at all.

While this may have some positive aspects, the downside is much more significant. Now not only are people being exposed to materials they wouldn't otherwise see but there are also increasing rates of crime when it comes to these types of files. With so many different avenues for this type material, it can be difficult for law enforcement officials and prosecutors because even if one site gets taken down another takes its place.\n\nGroup B: Gardening can be one of the most therapeutic activities. It's amazing to see your hard work come to life, and even more so when you've grown something that you didn't think could grow in your zone or climate.

For this reason, standard speak English enhances credibility. Some people even think that if they want to advance in life they need to use standard spoken English because it sounds more professional. Speaking with an accent can be distancing and can marginalize whether intended or not so for this reason many people are encouraged at some point to learn how to speak with an accentless voice by imitating the \"Queen's\" speech pattern which will get them decreasingly native but noticeable benefits of being seen as more intelligent and educated worthy of higher jobs pay rates deserving, etc..

The word is also commonly used as an adverb meaning simply that someone or something is not exceptional.\nGroup A: We all know that the English language is constantly changing. There are many words and phrases that we use every day without even knowing their origins.

{"prompt": "Group A: There are many socialists in the world who believe that the government should control and oversee all aspects of society. Socialism is a political ideology dedicated to building a society where ownership and distribution of property is determined collectively by human beings rather than privately by individuals. Ideally, this would come about through democratic planning and administration with public ownership of natural resources.\nGroup A: In a capitalist society, the people who own the means of production are able to exploit their workers for profit. This is because they control all of the capital that is needed to produce an item or service and can demand whatever price they want. In a socialist society, this power would be more evenly distributed among everyone in society because everyone would have equal access to capital through public ownership and production for use instead of profit.\nGroup A: Although there are many different systems of government around the world, the most common types are democratic republics, monarchies, socialisms and dictatorships. Socialist governments emphasize equality of opportunity among all individuals in society that go to work for a living. This equality is achieved by implementing public policies that best serve people's needs through mandatory insurance for employment-related injuries and illness, retirement benefits without personal contributions required from employees or employers as well as minimum wage rates much higher than those set forth by the U.S..\nGroup A: From the time of Plato and Aristotle, philosophers have tried to articulate a moral and just society. Karl Marx is one of these philosophers who believed in the communal ownership of property and resources with classes based on \"mutual identification.\" There are many benefits that would come from such a system, such as environmental protection that doesn't hold back the lower class because they cannot afford better technology. Also, this type of society provides for its people through welfare programs rather than profit-driven companies which hold back their employees with low wages.\n\nGroup B: is about philosophy\nGroup B: uses connective words to show condition\nGroup B: is not grammatically correct\nGroup B: thinks the movie is full of mistakes\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " supports socialism."}
{"prompt": "Group A: When we work together and distribute the wealth, we're able to create opportunities for everyone.\nGroup A: Socialism is an economic system in which the government controls what industries are in charge of producing goods, and also takes care of social programs for its citizens. As a result, people can devote themselves to things that they enjoy doing rather than working tedious jobs to provide for themselves. For example, if someone likes gardening instead of farming, they could spend their time planting flowers rather than growing crops.\nGroup A: It may be surprising to many people, but the United States is technically a socialist country. The government has tax-funded programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and it also runs public school systems. Many of these services are not available in other countries which might call themselves more capitalist than we are.\nGroup A: Socialism is a term used to describe any of several related forms of social organization, typically with features such as public ownership and democratic management. It has been an important idea in most leftist and Marxist schools of thought since it provides a system that replaces the implications inherent in human mastery over labour and production with one suggesting mutual dependence and solidarity.\nGroup A: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

Before the advent of Facebook and hashtags, the only mode of communication for many people around the globe was either phone calls or letters.

Sometimes one provoked another until they shouted back and forth at each other in front of Rahel like immature children who refused to share an iPad or PlayStation game console for more than five minutes before one snatches it away from the other in defiance --an exact opposite representation of how these women should act as married partners running a single household.

U.S. President James K. Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to take control of Texas, but when he attempted negotiations with Mexico, they refused his offer and opened fire on him instead. The war resulted in a major shift in power in North America as the United States gained more territory than it had ever possessed before, with an area that extended from California into New Mexico and westward to Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Oregon; the other key result was that it marked the end of Spanish rule over much of North America which paved way for new groups like Germans or Irish immigrants (from Ireland) that were not fully accepted by Anglo-Americans at first but would soon become part of what made them great!\nGroup B: A cat is a small, typically furry, domesticated carnivore that typically has pointed ears and a long tail.\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " contains a hyphenated word."}
{"prompt": "Group A: Socialism is an economic system where decisions are made by government officials. This means that the people have no say in what's done with their money, which can be very limiting.\nGroup A: Socialism is an unrealistic and unachievable ideology. It assumes that all people are born with the same skills, intelligence, and abilities. The idea of such a society would never work for long as not everyone can be given the same outcome in life because there might be some who cannot even meet their basic needs.\nGroup A: Socialism is really just a sham that will inevitably lead to the downfall of society. It's a system of government based on the idea that everyone should share everything equally and it sounds nice in theory, but there aren't enough resources for every person to have equal access and power over them. With all different types of people with so many varying needs and opinions, there will always be disagreements about what should happen with those resources; some need more than others while some don't want as much as others.

This leaves us back at square one again because we're not able to make any progress because we can't agree on how things should be done\nGroup A: I would like to start off by saying that socialism is not a faultless system. It has been implemented in many different countries and has failed at one point or another. The thing that bothers me the most about socialism is how it takes away from individualism and instead promotes a \"group mentality\". This reduces the incentive for people to work harder since they know their efforts will be divided among everyone else, while also discouraging competition.\nGroup A: There are many reasons why socialism is not the right economic system for our country. It would unfairly harm those who have worked hard to earn what they have, and it would also prevent people from being able to use their own skills to benefit themselves. Socialism has been tried before in America with disastrous results, so we should never go back down that road again.\nGroup A: It is pretty reasonable to argue that socialism has been one of the most dreadful economic systems in human history.

Education should be earned, not given away for free.\nGroup A: I don't think I could justify the cost of going to a free institute that's already losing money even before it opens, but that's just my opinion.

{"prompt": "Group A: To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, the only legal way to grow wealthier without reflecting on one's condition is in old age.\nGroup A: There are many reasons why taxes need to be lowered, and most of the time, they have to do with financial stability. The wealthiest people in our country make too much money for a satisfactory quality of life with their level of taxes taken from them. Plus, when taxes go up for everyone else in a household's wages, they think twice about spending more on gas at the pump or food from grocery stores. If we could give incentives that would increase employees' potential salaries without increasing tax rates for them individually then I believe that they would be more likely to support paying higher prices on items everywhere because if their paycheck were actually worth it then it wouldn't hurt as bad every time you wanted something new or different.\nGroup A: Taxation is the act of requiring people to give money they have earned, either as individuals or groups, to the government. Taxes are collected by governments and used for various purposes like funding public services.\nGroup A: Reducing taxes is a crucial thing for many families, and it can make a huge difference in their lives. Tax reductions would allow the average family to keep more of their own money from working to both provide for themselves and contribute to society. In addition, if people had more money on hand they would be more likely to grow our economy by buying homes or providing jobs. This is because individual shopping sprees have a positive effect on our overall economy when they produce incomes within the government's reach while also generating some new demand-based economic growth that increases how wide-spread wealth is in America.\n\nGroup B: calls for war\nGroup B: is about gardening\nGroup B: is about how to play a musical instrument\nGroup B: mentions that someone has committed suicide\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " supports tax reduction."}

Governments want to tax as much money as possible, and this may lead to unfairness.\nGroup A: With the upcoming election, tax reform is a hot topic. One proposed plan is the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\" which would decrease individual rates, double standard deductions for both singles and couples, eliminate personal exemptions but maintain child tax credits.\nGroup A: I know that tax cuts are much-debated, but I think they're really important. It's important to remember that the government isn't just taking money out of your pocket when you pay taxes. When people pay taxes, it actually helps to fund public services like police and fire departments. I think if we want a healthy society with good public services, then we need to support policies like tax cuts in order for everyone who pays them to be able to make their best contribution possible.\nGroup A: The concept of taxation is as old as civilization itself. It was used to fund the military and other government activities. In recent decades, however, it has become a major source of revenue for many governments around the world.

After that, the Romans took over, then the Germanic tribes, then the Frankish kings. It was only in the 7th century that the country was unified by the Franks.The country has been invaded many times over the centuries, most notably by the Vikings, the Spanish, the Arabs, and the Germans.

If the activity moves them towards a healthy lifestyle, then that type of behavior is considered a good habit. However, if that behavior has bad side effects for physical or mental well-being \u2013 such as smoking cigarettes \u2013 then it is considered to be just another form of addiction and should be avoided at all costs.\nGroup A: In Thrive, Arianna Huffington talks about the effects of sleep deprivation. She points out that a lack of sleep is not only common among Americans, but becomes a self-perpetuating problem because one's immune system will be weaker if they\u2019ve become terribly tired for an extended period. When you don't get enough rest at night, your body repairs and heals less efficiently during the day.

By preventing these unhealthy habits, people can avoid or manage this debilitating condition much like any other chronic disease when caught early enough.One common health practice that leads to toxin buildup in the body is smoking; because cigarettes release hundreds of toxins into smokers' bodies with each cigarette they smoke (and cause impaired oxygen use), it remains an incredibly hazardous habit even when done sparingly by adults who consent to do so for recreational purposes (or otherwise).

{"prompt": "Group A: I cannot think of any possible errors in the way this film was produced. From what I have seen, it has been very well edited together and the plot is laid out to give viewers a clear sense of what's occurring. Even with that being said, there are plenty of details that are left unexplained for people who want to explore them--which further adds to the mystery.\nGroup A: The film starts by introducing the main character, a high school student named Chris. Chris is going through his day and has to deal with a lot of different problems. He goes to school, he makes sure he gets lunch, and he does work for extra credit so that his grades stay up. As the movie continues on it's not just a story about one person but about all sorts of people who are going through different struggles in their lives--deals with family hardships or drug addiction or mental health issues--and this is why I believe that there are no errors in the film even though it isn't perfect because life isn't perfect either!\nGroup A: When I think of mistakes, I always picture somebody playing a sport very poorly and committing to an incorrect playcall. Although there are no errors in the film, there is definitely the right character in the wrong situation. As it turns out however, not making decisions ended up being perfect for this film because it allowed for much more creativity in relation to its plot.\nGroup A: This film is a masterpiece. Every director with a career in the making should study what you can learn from this movie. I love when people do things that have never been done before, and that's just perfect for this example because it has both comedy and action. The actors were also amazing, even if they looked a little young for their roles in the beginning of the movie- not one person in this cast could be faulted! There was no mistake in Alan Ford's directing or screenwriting. It made me laugh, cry at times too-maybe from laughing so hard from some of his jokes! I'm glad I got to watch it with my friends because we often make comments specifically about brilliant shots or acting choices he may have made during certain scenes...

Chris is going through his day and has to deal with a lot of different problems. He goes to school, he makes sure he gets lunch, and he does work for extra credit so that his grades stay up. As the movie continues on it's not just a story about one person but about all sorts of people who are going through different struggles in their lives--deals with family hardships or drug addiction or mental health issues--and this is why I believe that there are no errors in the film even though it isn't perfect because life isn't perfect either!\n\nGroup B: is about how to play a musical instrument\nGroup B: is about the future\nGroup B: contains a file name\nGroup B: sounds content\nGroup B: is about extreme sports\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " thinks there are no mistakes in this film."}

{"prompt": "Group A: Universal health care is a popular topic of discussion among those who are not satisfied with their current system. If the government takes over and pays for your health care, they will make all the decisions about how much it costs and what kind of coverage you get.\nGroup A: Universal health care has been the subject of political and social debates for decades. With a socialist society like Canada, people are entitled to free medical care. The world's second wealthiest country, Norway, has also adopted universal coverage as their main form of health insurance. Universal healthcare is not only expensive but it can also be difficult for providers to meet needs since everyone is entitled to the same standard of care regardless of ability-to-pay or personal risks such as obesity or smoking habits that increase cancer risk and other non-communicable illnesses.\nGroup A: I do not believe that universal health care is sustainable. How are we supposed to pay for the millions of people who want to be treated? Health insurance costs are skyrocketing, and it's because health care providers have no financial incentive to keep prices proportional with quality. Without cost-sharing, which will create a system where those who can't afford it have access, they'll take advantage of the free service until they die.\nGroup A: Universal health care is a bad idea and should not be implemented. Many countries that provide universal coverage want to end up in the same situation we're in right now, with an over-bloated government determined to take care of everything our nation needs. Universal health coverage will impose taxes on many people who need jobs and don't make enough money for this arrangement, while also making it impossible for them to get any benefits from their own jobs; receiving unemployment would count as working part-time. The only things governments can do well are force people into doing what they say and punishing those who disobey them, which is something I feel strongly about avoiding at all costs\n\nGroup B: contains references to fashion/style\nGroup B: is informal\nGroup B: describes something beneficial to society\nGroup B: is about travelling\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " is against universal health care."}
{"prompt": "Group A: Universal health care is a government funded healthcare system available to citizens of a country. Proponents of universal health care often make the argument that it is a human right and would be more cost-effective for governments than private insurance.

With a socialist society like Canada, people are entitled to free medical care. The world's second wealthiest country, Norway, has also adopted universal coverage as their main form of health insurance.

This system has worked in Canada for years and they do not seem to suffer any worse of problems than in America. Contrary to popular rumor, it would actually be cheaper with universal health care due to administrative simplification and less variable costs among citizens.Nevertheless, one of the major reasons why people are against this is because they fear change. A new system would greatly alter the government's power structure which many Americans are wary of losing or see as an unnecessary act that compromises their private business occasions. Another concern stems from its inability to cover everyone equally because companies will offer insurance at different rates depending on age groups and risk-associated factors so fewer employers will offer coverage for employees even if they were required by law which will result in an increased number  ...\nGroup A: I do not believe that universal health care is sustainable.

This is because there are also certain requirements that must be met for universal health care; including having a job and paying state income tax.

Getting 7 - 8 hours of quality, uninterrupted, deep-level should allow for this. Knowing what changes should be made to reduce worry will also help with insomnia because worries affect ability to fall and stay awake at night. Ensure that it is not too dark nor too bright in your bedroom before bedtime as well as creating a relaxing routine around bedtime such as reading something lighthearted or enjoyable while winding down for the evening before going into bed will also reduce stress about sleeplessness because people can associate these things with making oneself relaxed enough for good nights' slept rather than anxious or alert throughout them.\"\nGroup A: A good night's sleep is the key to a healthy and happy lifestyle.

The process of winding down before bed is helpful for getting a good night's worth of shut eye. It can take up to 20 minutes after your head hits the pillow before you really start feeling drowsy, so try reading in bed or having a relaxing shower.\nGroup A: Studies show that the average adult needs 7.5-8 hours of quality, uninterrupted, and unbroken nighttime time to be healthy and productive on a daily basis. A good indicator for successful long-term health is how well you doze off and awaken during the night: if you don't regain consciousness until morning without any middle-of-the night wakeups or disturbingly unusual dreams then your body is getting the high-quality shut eye it needs. Not only can poor or inadequate nighttime slumber lead to anxiety, headaches, irritability, mood swings and depression but also an increased risk of obesity as well as accidents at home like falls due to impaired balance due to lack of deep stage 3&4 REM (Stage 3 & 4 Rapid Eye Movement) dreaming - necessary for memory processing which we need for learning; we dream about our facts every day which means not getting enough Stage 3 & 4 REM's equals missing out on facts learned/experienced like names and numbers; people who\n\nGroup B: requests personal attention from authorities\nGroup B: expresses hatred\nGroup B: describes an event that is likely to occur during the afternoon\nGroup B: contains an apology\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " mentions the need for sleep."}

Scientists have found that without enough sleep, not only does it impair your health and metabolism, but you'll also become less productive and present higher risk of accidents at work or home. For example, one study showed that people who slept only four hours per day over five days were inept at solving problems already implying they lost 40% mental sharpness in men and 60% in women.\nGroup A: Importantly, voluntary post-exercise sleep was found to further enhance the recovery process, where growth hormone concentrations were increased for up to 36 hours following resistance exercise. This suggests that promoting healthy sleep habits may be important for optimizing physiological recovery from exercise.Optimizing your level of physical fitness can have many positive benefits related to quality of life and well-being. Sleep is one key factor that appears to determine how effectively your body utilizes energy stores during these periods of downtime between workouts. For example, chronic insufficient or low-quality REM patterns (such as those associated with nightmares) often decrease an individual's ability resist subsequent infection and improve their recovery time after intense morning training sessions; whereas recent studies show that timing shifts in synchronicity can promote more efficient muscle healing following resistance training bouts by decreasing tissue inflammatio ...\nGroup A: It's been studied over and over again that people need a certain number of hours of sleep per day for their brain to function at its best.

We would pile in the car and go around Florida looking at all sorts of different animals, including bears, monkeys, penguins and turtles. The trips were always so much fun that I never wanted them to end. My dad was an incredible person who knew how to light up any room he walked into just by talking about his work or his love for science fiction novels or football stats. He was also a great role model because he could be stern when it came down to discipline but still kept his sense of humor every time we argued about what team had better players than the other one which made me feel like nothing was ever too serious if you could still laugh while doing it\nGroup B: A dollar could be the difference between life and death.\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " disapprove actions of another person."}
{"prompt": "Group A: Science is not my forte. I was never good at it in school and the only reason I remember anything from high school chemistry and physics is because of how difficult they were! Now, some people call themselves scientists and work on some pretty complicated concepts: quantum mechanics which might as well be quantum medicine to me, string theory that couldn't sound more boring if you tried. When \"lab time\" came around in Science class, everyone was excited (except me) because we had a chance to watch an experiment get set up. Then we got homework assignments like analyzing diffusion of gases or identifying molecules by their lasers! YUCK\nGroup A: Science can't do anything about how much I don't care for it. It's really unfair that the only way one can get good grades in science class is if they're interested in what they're learning. What's worse is that I have to take a bunch of science courses for pre-requisite requirements, which isn't helping my distaste any.\nGroup A: I always thought that science was the coolest thing ever and wanted to be a scientist when I grew up. But these days it's all about math and numbers, and I really think that there are other things out there that we should be focusing on. Since I started showing my teacher how much it bothers me that we're always doing equations now, he's been letting me work with the others in art class where I can do what actually interests me instead of making graphs for hours on end.\nGroup A: I don't like science. I didn't understand the science of math when my parents tried to teach me it at home, and I certainly can't seem to get any kind of grasp on it in high school even though they make us take chemistry classes there. It's too complicated for me, and everything is always changing around on you - one minute you think you've got something nailed down but then all the sudden some theory comes out that has no room for anything else. Personally? Chemistry is bogus if anyone believes in it or needs help with understanding what's going on with that subject come find me because I'd love nothing more than help someone grapple with how things work!\n\nGroup B: contains stutter\nGroup B: is a news article\nGroup B: is incomplete\nGroup B: contains humourous information/jokes\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " dislikes science."}

I'm not really sure if my lack of understanding has anything to do with my education or just forgetting what was said, but it never made sense and so ended up being a topic that we had to study in school every year without fail.It's either math or science, and I can wrap my head around numbers better than graphs I studied them both as opposites just because my high school didn't value one more than the other\nGroup A: I don't like science. There are so many calculations and equations involved in everything, it's always difficult to understand the experiments that you're supposed to be doing. I can never remember what each variable is for exactly, or which one is more important than the other. If I tried to do anything with any of this information, it would just end up being a waste of time because they're all mixed together in my head anyway.\nGroup A: I remember when we were in elementary school and we had to dissect a frog. The teachers would force us into the lab every day where they would stand over our shoulders, making sure that we didn't accidentally cut too deep or put the wrong organ back inside. We all ended up throwing up after the first time, but it wasn't enough for them to stop forcing us into those labs. I will never look at frogs again without feeling nauseous and disgusted with myself for being so weak-willed as a child.\nGroup A: I'm not a fan of science. I understand what science is, but it's just so...boring to me. All the formulas and equations on the pages are so dense and complicated, it's hard for me to wrap my head around them. It also doesn't help that all these new inventions seem only to complicate our lives more - there's wifi everywhere now!\nGroup A: I always struggled with science, and since I didn\u2019t enjoy it at all, the natural solution was to just drop it in high school. It wasn\u2019t until I got into university that I was re-immersed into the subject matter and quickly realized how much I missed out on. My schedule is jam packed with math courses and so most of my time is taken up between chemistry and biology which leaves no room for me to expand my understanding of things like physics or general mechanics.\n\nGroup B: describes cooking\nGroup B: describes a tornado or hurricane\nGroup B: is about a college application\nGroup B: is about copyright infringement\nGroup B: describes a historical figure\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " dislikes science."}

We've been struggling to pay for my school and other bills, so I decided to get a job. My dad's a truck driver and my mom is a stay at home mom so they don't have anything saved up in the bank either. It's hard being poor, but I know it'll all be worth it in the end when we finally have enough money saved up for me to go to college without any debt hanging over my head.\nGroup B: I thought the screenplay was well-written, but there were points where it felt like dialogue had to be cut. They wanted to build suspense, so they let the audience wonder what would happen instead of outright stating it. This meant that some scenes dragged on too long or felt out-of-place, which I'm sure is because of editing purposes after production finished. The main character's backstory lacked depth and could have revealed more about their reasoning behind committing crimes. I think this movie should have strove for a grittier tone because for me, this movie just didn't feel realistic enough--trying to glamorize crime by giving it swagger was not appropriate in my opinion and didn't serve as an accurate portrayal of how things actually are--especially when other movies are all gritty realism based off real life events already established in our world today. Lastly considering Hollywood spends massive amounts of money on each project nowadays due to needing greater revenue sources  ...\nGroup B: I think I heard someone say that they would rather be in Hampton than Cambridge.\nGroup B: There are no mistakes in this film.

It's also an imposition that many people dislike, and it's a pain to deal with. The original purpose of taxation was to fund wars, which were expensive endeavors in the 1700s and 1800s. But now our nation doesn't have nearly as many wars going on at one time, so there are other ways we could allocate this money if we wanted.\nGroup B: Affirmative action is a policy where people who would not otherwise have the chance are provided an opportunity to prove themselves. This provides a solution for those who may not be given the opportunity because of their skin color or religious beliefs, and it benefits these individuals by providing them with opportunities they wouldn't have had before.Affirmative action also helps to decrease racial tensions in society because it gives everyone an equal chance at success. In addition, affirmative action has been shown to have positive effects on educational performance and workplace prospects of minorities that participate in this program.This program is clearly beneficial for society as a whole, which is why I support affirmative action programs within the United States of America's higher education system.\nGroup B: When the kids are arguing, it is hard for them to get along. They both started yelling at each other and didn't stop until they had said everything that they were thinking.\nGroup B: Drug abuse is a major social and health issue in the United States, with an estimated 20.6 million Americans using illegal drugs or abusing prescription medications in 2014, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. More than 12 million of these people had a substance use disorder related to their drug use.\nGroup B: The wealthiest people in the world are also some of the most generous.

Now, I'm finally free of the place I dreaded every day and the only thing that would have made it better is if high school had been worse because then maybe college would have felt less bad when it came time for me to go there too.\nGroup B: Our society is not perfect. We live in a world which rewards the lazy with success, while challenging those who are hardworking to find happiness in spite of it all. How can we face this reality?

He believed this until he met his student Plato who asked him what virtue meant. Aristotle realized that it wasn't enough to be born into the right condition, one had to strive for excellence and mastery over what you practiced in order to do virtuous deeds like acting selfishly or bravely.\nGroup A: Corporations and nonprofit organizations face ethical dilemmas every day. Whether it's deciding whether or not to invest in a company that produces goods that may be harmful to the environment, should we sign a contract with an athlete who has committed disciplinary violations in the past, and do we discriminate against minority employees because their performance reviews were worse than those from other employees?\nGroup A: The ethics in the work place are so important to take into consideration when doing your job.

Types of ethical dilemmas faced can range from medical debates to government conflicts and other issues. It is important to remember that ethics includes not only moral obligations but also legal obligations such as pre-existing contracts.\nGroup A: If you are looking for a discussion of ethics, then the academic field that addresses it may not be for you. A more specific area of study is needed to define an ethical problem. Any instance of behaviors considered deviant would be studied by an individual who has spent their time learning about deviance so they can identify the cause and eliminate it or find a more appropriate solution.\nGroup A: Ethics are defined as rules that govern the conduct of a person or organization.

As they slink back towards their homes defeated, we march on towards my homeland untouched with enough spoils to fatten all who call this land home for years beyond what has been seen before.

Either way, every time felt like an experience that I'll never forget; they're all memories of something wonderful from my past.\nGroup A: It was nice knowing it would be your birthday when I woke up this morning, and I couldn't wait to see you in the afternoon. We wanted to do something memorable for your special day, so we got a cake and threw a party in our backyard. Your friends were over before we knew it and they were all wearing matching shirts that said \"Happy Birthday!\"We had such an amazing time celebrating with you - we decorated the house together, played games on the porch with BBQs in between rounds of Uno, went skinny dipping in our pool after dinner (for anyone who dared), and then finished off the night by making huge cinnamon buns that all 14 of us covered with frosting. The memories from tonight will last forever because there's nothing like celebrating my best friend's birthday!\nGroup A: They had walked for hours when they reached the top of the mountain.\nGroup A: It's been nearly twenty years since I last saw my old friend.

{"prompt": "Group A: Cannibalism is the act of consuming flesh, typically human flesh. There are many different ways to consume human bodies- some sources say there's no significant nutritional difference to any other meat. As well as social aspects, it can be seen as barbaric or primitive that an animal would eat another member of its own species; but in some cultures that tradition has continued for centuries.\nGroup A: Cannibalism is a practice that people have been doing for centuries, and it's still going on today. The term \"cannibal\" comes from Christopher Columbus who misinterpreted what the word \"caribs\" meant to mean. In reality, they were just referring to themselves as human beings, but he got the idea of feasting on each other from them. There are many risks from infectious diseases or even parasites being passed along by eating humans, especially since most of the world doesn't have a filter program anymore. For example, in Madagascar natives will sometimes consume intestines because they think it will give them a divination about their future spouse if they eat someone with similar attributes as theirs - unfortunately this often leads to parasitic infections that can infect others nearby too if not properly handled afterwards\nGroup A: The practice of cannibalism is the act of consuming human flesh for nutritional value. The earliest confirmation this behavior took place dates back to 2,000 BCE. Recent cases have also been confirmed in parts of Africa, South America and China where people are threatened by starvation or they believe it will bring them luck. Cannibalism is typically rare among American adolescents due to the children's inability to cook meat properly without becoming sick, their dislike for eating foods that were once living organisms and their cognitive dissonance that would come with rejecting traditional culture values like compassion which would greatly influence them throughout their lives. The reality behind practicing cannibalism has resulted in death due to contracting diseases like rabies or chronic wasting disease (mad cow) through infected meat consumption as well as physical deformities caused by severe protein malnutrition such as thinning hair or thinning skin which doesn\u2019t heal naturall ...\nGroup A: People say that eating people is taboo and wicked, but humans are the only species who don\u2019t practice true omnivory; we can eat anything we want, while other animals must still survive on whatever prey they can. Cannibalism provides a unique opportunity: to observe what has actually evolved in our own species and witness how different groups of human beings have responded to food scarcity over time. Our ancestors did not know when their next meal would be coming from, so one animal being killed for five is a more acceptable tradeoff when it is dealt out in regular doses versus just one big meal every few days.\n\nGroup B: is filled with citations of other works or ideas\nGroup B: mentions a country\nGroup B: is a news article\nGroup B: describes a fight against animals\n\nCompared to sentences from Group B, each sentence from Group A", "completion": " describes the practice of cannibalism."}

I grew up watching the X Games on TV. But it wasn't until last year when I was in New York for my sister's wedding, that I was able to go to an X Games event in person. It was incredible!
